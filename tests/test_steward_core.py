"""Kepler steward assessment core (issue #198). Offline: no GitHub, no AWS, no model.

The main scenario is built from the public facts of PR #179 (a first-time contributor's fork PR,
CLA requested but not yet accepted, CI waiting for approval). The CLA rules themselves are the
repository's own gate, loaded from `.github/scripts`, so these tests also pin that the steward and
the merge check agree.
