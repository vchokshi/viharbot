## Agent Skills & Capabilities Registry
**Version 1.0 | October 2026**

**Status:** Proposed  
**Architecture reference:** Agent Architecture v1.1  
**Scope:** Eight existing agent identities

### 1. Registry Model

Each skill shall be represented by a versioned, machine-readable definition.

Required metadata:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `skill_id` | Stable, unique identifier |
| `version` | Semantic version |
| `name` | Human-readable skill name |
| `description` | Professional purpose |
| `owner` | Primary agent identity |
| `eligible_agents` | Additional authorized candidates |
| `category` | Consulting discipline |
| `inputs` | Required input contract |
| `outputs` | Expected output contract |
| `required_tools` | Tools needed for execution |
| `required_scopes` | Authorization requirements |
| `data_classifications` | Permitted information classifications |
| `dependencies` | Other skills or capabilities required |
| `evaluation` | Acceptance and quality criteria |
| `status` | Lifecycle status |

A skill's existence in this registry shall not imply that it is executable.

### 2. Skill Lifecycle

Skills shall use the following lifecycle:

**Proposed → Defined → Implemented → Tested → Enabled → Deprecated**

`proposed`: Concept identified; no execution contract guaranteed.

`defined`: Metadata and input/output contracts approved.

`implemented`: Executable implementation exists.

`tested`: Required automated tests pass.

`enabled`: Approved for execution in a specified environment.

`deprecated`: No longer available for new assignments.

Execution availability shall additionally depend on capability bindings, runtime health, and authorization.

Supporting expertise does not automatically grant execution authority.

### 12. Skills Evaluation

Each enabled skill shall have automated evaluations appropriate to its purpose.

Evaluation dimensions include:

**Correctness:** Is the output accurate?

**Completeness:** Were required elements included?

**Evidence:** Are claims supported?

**Security:** Were authorization and data boundaries respected?

**Relevance:** Does the output address the task?

**Consistency:** Does the output conform to its schema?

**Efficiency:** Were resources used appropriately?

**Collaboration:** Were dependencies and peer-review requirements satisfied?

**Actionability:** Can the output support a real decision or implementation?

### 13. Registry Governance

New skills may be proposed by agents or human operators.

A skill shall not become executable until its implementation, permissions, tests, and execution binding have been approved.

Changes shall be version-controlled.

Removing or materially changing an existing skill shall require compatibility review.

The registry shall support future agents without requiring changes to the identities or histories of existing team members.
