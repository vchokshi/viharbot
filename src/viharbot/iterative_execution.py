"""Bounded, iterative orchestration with application-side authorization.

Charlie proposes one action at a time. The application authorizes every action, runs approved
capabilities on the existing services through the same validated boundary as the fixed
pipeline, and decides when the task may complete. This is controlled coordination, not
unrestricted autonomy: explicit loop, explicit budgets, no parallelism, no retries.
