"""One poll: find first-time contributors' pull requests, assess them, alert on what is new.

The rules that matter:

* Read-only against GitHub. The only write-like thing it does is publish an email to the founder.
* One bad pull request does not stop the others: its failure is audited and counted, and the run
  is reported `partial`. A failure of the audit log or the state store aborts the run and sends
  nothing, because without them there is no deduplication and no record.
* An alert is claimed in the state table before it is published and marked sent afterwards, so a
  re-poll or a duplicate event does not re-alert. A crash in between allows at most
  `max_alert_attempts - 1` retries; after that the alert is reported once as exhausted and never
  sent again. An `alert_intent` is audited before the email leaves: an audit outage before it sends
  nothing, one after it cannot unsend the email and is found through `uncertain_intents`.
* No read, claim or email starts after the deadline (reads stop `FINALIZE_RESERVE_SECONDS` early).
  The worst overrun is the one GitHub read already in flight, bounded by the client's attempts and
  wait. A run reads a bounded number of pull requests and reports through metrics from its final
  status: `PollCompleted` is the heartbeat, `PollFailed` is 1 unless every step succeeded.
* A dry run reads and assesses but writes nothing: no claim, no audit row, no email.
* Nothing returned or logged contains contributor-written text, a token or a key.
