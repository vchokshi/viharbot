"""Outbound service assertions (ADR-006, step A2b): mint a caller assertion for one HTTP request.

The callee side is ``service_auth``. This module only decides whether to attach an
``X-Viharbot-Assertion`` header to a plain HTTP call and builds it with ``service_auth``'s own
canonicalization and minting code (nothing is re-implemented here).

Issuer location: option A of ADR-006 ("Where the issuer's key lives") is accepted (founder decision,
2026-11-03): the web/orchestrator process holds the key and signs, via ``InProcessIssuer``.
``AssertionIssuer`` is kept as the seam so a separate internal signer (option B) can replace it
later without changing any caller. docs/service-authentication.md says what this does not change.

Off by default. With ``VIHARBOT_OUTBOUND_AUTH`` unset nothing here runs and requests are unchanged.
When it is on and a header cannot be produced, ``OutboundAuthError`` is raised and the caller must
not send the request (fail closed; there is no unauthenticated fallback).
